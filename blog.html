            <h2 class="topic">Is A Calorie Really A Calorie?</h2>

            <p class="content">We often think of calories as something we eat, but, the truth is, a calorie is simply a unit of energy. More specifically, a calorie is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature
            of one gram of water by one degree celsius.
            What does the temperature of water have to do with calories in your food? Well, scientists determine the
            amount of calories in a food using a technique we’re all guilty of in the kitchen: they burn it

            This process is called bomb calorimetry. First, you place an ingredient in a sealed stainless steel
            container surrounded by water. Then, heat is applied to the food until it burns. This chemical reaction
            generates a ton of heat and slowly heats the surrounding water. Scientists then measure how high the
            temperature of the water rises to calculate the number of calories in the food.

            Although accurate, this process is slowly losing favor. Today, most calories listed by the USDA and FDA
            are calculated in a different way. Instead of burning the food, the total amount of calories are
            determined by adding up the calories provided by the individual components of the food. This means
            determining the amount of energy from the protein, carbohydrates, fat, and alcohol.

            This method works because the calories in a gram of protein, carbohydrates, fat, and alcohol remain
            constant. Each macronutrient has the following caloric values:

            1 gram of protein = 4 calories
            1 gram of carbohydrates = 4 calories
            1 gram of fat = 9 calories
            1 gram of alcohol = 7 calories
            That’s how you add up the calories in your food. But, that’s not the entire story. As you’re about to
            find out, macronutrients are metabolized differently, which is why all calories are not equal. Some
            foods (like protein) burn more calories during digestion, and other foods (like the fiber in your
            carbs), affect hunger and appetite.
            Understanding how to balance your diet to give you the right amount of sanity – while not letting your
            hunger go wild – is the key to feeling in control of your diet.

            <h2 class="topic">How To Have a Great Workout, Every Workout</h2>

            <p class="content">Some weeks, you might not be feeling your workouts. It happens to all of us. Whether you’ve got a lot going on at work or sleeping terribly, you will be lagging some days. 

                Here’s the key: It’s not about pushing the limits; it’s about learning how to have a great workout every time, no matter what is happening in your life or if you’re not “feeling it.” 
                
                At Born Fitness, we measure success by using a simple hierarchy:
                
                Are you consistently exercising? (Consistent can be 2-3 days a week or 4-5; both are good, but the key is whether you hit your goal week-after-week)
                Are you training with intensity? (intensity is relative to your ability)
                That’s it. Sure, given those two details, we’ll make adjustments so that clients can see results, but we don’t worry about things like how long a workout lasts or feel married to specific exercises.
                
                Instead, it’s about finding what works for the client, creating a plan they can follow, and making sure they work hard, whether it’s for 15 minutes or an hour.
                
                But, it also means our clients need to know and understand how to train with intensity.
                Now, before you think we’re about to rant about “GO BIG OR GO HOME,” that approach is likely to violate Rule #1 about consistency. We want you to train with intensity given how you feel on any given day.

                After all, it’s common for you to feel like crap some days, and the idea of needing to “bring the intensity” can be enough to prevent you from training. That’s what we want to avoid. 

                A training plan designed for real life means some days are PRs. Other days might feel like a small step back…but they all add up to consistency and consistent intensity, and that results in some crazy results and amazing transformations. 

                Here’s some math that explains why (Don’t worry, it’s not “real” math.)

                Assume that approximately 25% of workouts are going to be a struggle, 50% of days are nothing special but lead to small changes, and 25% of days are amazing. If you show up on all of these days, your health will improve in life-changing ways.

                The 25% crappy days are crappy, but they are better than nothing. It’s progress because you showed up and worked hard. Even if “on paper” it looks like a step back, this is a HUGE step forward. The 50% of days when you feel human, you’re making those small incremental changes that are the foundation of success in anything. And, the 25% of days where you are superhuman, that’s where you push the limits and expand your “ceiling” of what’s possible.

                Add it all up, and you see that even if 75% of days are less than how you wish you felt, you’re 150% getting better. Trust me, it’s science.

            <h2 class="topic">Redefining “Healthy”: Food Proposal Aims to Curtail Consumer Confusion</h2>

            <p class="content">“Is this food healthy?” Health coaches and exercise professionals are undoubtedly familiar with this question from their clients.  

                A proposal from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hopes to provide clarity to the standards for which packaged foods are eligible to be labeled “healthy.” The existing definition was adopted in 1994 and allows food manufacturers to include the word “healthy” on food packaging as long as the food meets certain criteria, including limited amounts of total fat, saturated fat, sodium and cholesterol. The product must also contribute at least 10% of the daily value of one or more of the following nutrients: vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein or dietary fiber. Only about 5% of all packaged foods currently qualify for the “healthy” label, according to the FDA.  
                
                The new proposal marks a shift toward current nutrition science, as well as federal dietary guidance. It also underscores the importance of the food we consume. Currently, six out of 10 adults in the United States live with a chronic disease, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes, while four in 10 have two or more. Poor nutrition is a leading cause of illness in the U.S., and a significant risk factor for many health disorders. In fact, fewer than one in 10 adolescents and adults in the United States eat enough fruits or vegetables, while the consumption levels of added sugar, saturated fat and sodium are too high. The updated criteria are aimed at helping to improve nutrition and dietary patterns and at reducing the burden of chronic illness. 
                
                The revised definition of “healthy” would require a pivot toward establishing that a product contains a certain amount of food from a minimum of one of the food groups or subgroups from the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. These include fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy and protein foods. The new proposal would also set specific limits, based on a percentage of the set daily value, for added sugars, saturated fat and sodium. 
                
                “Increased attention to the healthfulness of our food supply is a conscious step in the right direction,” says Tiffany Holt, MS, RD, who works at the University of California San Diego Centers for Integrative Health. “With staggering increases in chronic disease, matched with a marked decrease in food quality in the modern world, we clearly need a course correction.” 
                
                While Holt posits that the new proposal is a good start, she also believes that lasting, meaningful changes will likely require additional considerations. 
                
                It’s not a surprise that foods such as raw whole fruits and vegetables would qualify as “healthy” foods under the new proposal. Water, as well as foods such as avocados, nuts, seeds, higher-fat fish and certain oils, none of which qualify as “healthy” under the current definition, would see a reversal of that designation under the new proposal. However, foods such as highly sweetened cereal or yogurt would lose their “healthy” definition. Using cereal as an example, in order to obtain the “healthy” label, a serving size would need to contain at least three-fourths of an ounce of whole grains and no more than 1 gram of saturated fat, 230 milligrams of sodium and 2.5 grams of added sugars.  
                
                “As a dietitian nutritionist, when considering the healthfulness of a dietary pattern, we look to wholesome foods as the most nutrient-dense options for meeting a person’s energy needs,” Holt says. “Unfortunately, this proposal is largely applied to processed and ultra-processed foods, of which there are few ‘healthy’ products. The example in the proposal using cereal is still a processed food, albeit better than other processed options with 18 to 20 grams of sugar per serving. Instead, could we support actual whole grains such as oats and quinoa to pair with fruit, nuts, perhaps one-half teaspoon of a sweetener, and a caloric liquid, such as milk?”  
                
                Holt also suggests that an additional focus could be placed on limiting non-nutritive food additives that may play roles in poor digestion, disturbances in appetite and fullness signaling, as well as an overall ongoing contribution to noncommunicable chronic diseases. Other considerations, Holt says, could require placing the nutrition facts label and the full list of ingredients on the front of the food package, which would place less of a focus on marketing design and claims, and possibly incentivize food manufacturers to seek ingredient sourcing from naturally occurring foods. The FDA is currently studying whether to relocate the nutrition label to the front of the package in order to make it more visible. 
                
                Ultimately, the FDA hopes this new proposal will provide consumers with an efficient visual tool that will make it easier to make informed choices about healthy dietary practices. Some research studies support the connection between providing nutrition information on packaging and healthy diets. In fact, a meta-analysis in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine concluded that food labeling can be effective in reducing consumer intake of total energy and fat, while increasing the consumption of vegetables. Further, a randomized controlled trial revealed an association between consumers who use food labels and the healthy quotient of the products purchased. 
                
                If the rule is approved, it will be important for ACE Certified Professionals and other health and exercise professionals to become familiar with its details and nuances. The measure may represent an opportunity to provide approved nutrition information to support long-term health behavior change while staying within a defined scope of practice.

            <h2 class="topic">How to Protect Your Mental and Physical Health While Working From Home</h2>

            <p class="content">The past few years have seen a dramatic shift in how, when and where people work, as many employers loosened the rules on who could work from home. Many employees are continually refining workspaces that blur the lines between home, career, life and family. And, while working from home can be advantageous for many people, it can also create unique mental and physical health challenges, particularly for those who end up spending more time sitting, streaming and snacking. 

                Fortunately, there are ways you can protect your mental and physical health while working from home—it just takes a little extra planning, communication and discipline. 
                
                Creating a healthy work-from-home approach is not only about designing a productive and positive environment that supports your work. It’s also about finding ways to deal with the inevitable stress that comes with this new way of working. 
                
                Whether you’re working from home full-time or you’re in a hybrid home/office situation, consider using these tips to help prevent some of the stress that comes with always being just steps away from your workspace. 
                
                Create a schedule. The benefit of working in an office is the physical delineation between working and home life and socialization with colleagues. Putting a schedule in place that has clear start and stop times and includes breaks for food, exercise and connection can help you avoid burnout and feeling isolated. 
                
                Establish boundaries and communicate them. With a schedule comes the inevitable task of establishing boundaries with coworkers, family members and others who demand your time and attention. Keep in mind, however, that boundaries without communication can lead to misunderstandings, confusion and frustration. Be sure to communicate with the important people in your life what your work and life boundaries are and how and when you will be available to them and meet your commitments. 
                
                Take wellness breaks. Often overlooked in a work-from-home arrangement is physical and mental wellness. For many, the routine is wake up, caffeinate, work, dinner, sleep, repeat. Taking wellness breaks throughout the day, however, is as important as any meeting or other obligation. Schedule time for fresh air, movement and hydration. Once per hour, step away from your devices and do something for yourself. Walk the dog, stretch, refill your water bottle, meditate, etc. These breaks from work can help revive your energy, focus and creativity. 
                
                Regardless of your work situation, stress inevitably crops up. Here are three strategies that can help you cope with and conquer stress and ultimately protect your mind and body. 
                
                Breathing exercises can help increase feelings of calm, reduce stress and improve concentration. Performed regularly, deep breathing may also help reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. Box breathing, which is described in the video below, is another technique that may help you connect with your breath. 

                When in a stressful situation, get up and get moving. It doesn’t have to be an hour-long cardio session. Simple, low-impact options that don’t require equipment or even a change of clothing include walking outdoors, yoga flow and dancing. Check out the five-minute mood-boosting workout below. 

                Stress eating is a very real thing. When you want to stress eat, nourish your mind and your body by choosing a soothing meditation followed by a calming food or beverage. A quick 5- to 10-minute meditation that is uplifting and empowering followed by a cup of chamomile tea may help to reduce stress and improve your mood. Avoid alcohol and ultra-processed foods that may satisfy a craving but will leave you feeling sapped of energy and even more stressed in the end. 

                No matter where you work, stress is simply a part of life. Learning how to manage your schedule, maintain your health and wellness routines, and deal with the stress that’s sure to come will not only protect your mental and physical health but also make you a better partner, parent, coworker and leader. 

                5-minute Mood-booster Workout 

                No equipment needed. Be sure to wear clothes that can move with you. 

                1-minute cardio warm-up: Dance, jumping jacks, stair climbing, etc. 

                30-seconds of each exercise: 

                Body-weight squats 

                Push-ups 

                Alternating reverse lunges 

                Triceps dips on a step or chair 

                Sumo squats 

                Plank 

                1-minute cool-down with stretching or yoga poses

            <h2 class="topic">Mental Health in the Black Community: An Unspoken Issue</h2>

            <p class="content">The topic of mental health has long been a taboo subject in the Black community, even more so than in society at large. As a result, just one in three Black people who struggled with mental health issues in the past year used mental health services. Low rates of use can be attributed to many factors, including lack of insurance, cost, and the limited availability of culturally competent providers. Couple that with the fact that 21% of Black adults report serious psychological distress and a troubling scenario reveals itself. 

                There are many possible reasons why the Black community might experience a disproportionate number of mental health concerns, including the racial inequities seen in almost all sectors of society, including healthcare. In addition, the long history of dehumanization, oppression and violence against Black people has evolved into modern structural and institutional racism, which affects mental health in countless ways. In combination, this often manifests as a distrust of the government and large institutions, including the medical system. Also, socioeconomic disparities that are common in the Black community often limit access to health insurance and other vital health-related resources. 
                
                While society has become more cognizant of these issues, and increasingly willing to talk about them in a meaningful and productive way, we are still falling well short of the ultimate goal of equity for every individual in all segments of society.  
                
                The normalization of discussions of mental health, particularly in the Black community, is just one small piece of the complex topic of holistic health. Instead of focusing on the “mental health struggles” of the Black community, a more positive spin on this situation that health coaches and exercise professionals may want to adopt involves celebrating Black joy, which many experts and activists cite as a centerpiece of Black culture. 
                
                As a health coach or exercise professional, you can facilitate that joy by celebrating Black culture through not only a purposeful acceptance of all clients and participants, regardless of their skin color, but also through marketing and social media content that shows Black people feeling the joy and reaping the rewards of physical activity. The objective is to create a facility and a community of members who feel not only welcomed and empowered, but also respected and valued, regardless of their background. 
                
                Of course, it is not appropriate for health coaches and exercise professionals to diagnose mental health concerns. That said, the positive effects of physical activity on mental health are well documented, so it is certainly appropriate for you to emphasize these benefits when working with clients, particularly Black clients. When discussing programming and behavior change with clients, for example, consider highlighting the fact that physical activity is associated with reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. Encourage your clients to incorporate one or more of the following mindfulness techniques into their daily routines: 
                
                Mindful movement: Most people think of yoga, tai chi or qigong when they think of mindful movement—and these are all fantastic options—but walking, running, cycling and rowing can also be mindful if distractions are removed, both internal and external, and focus is placed on the repetition of the movement, one’s breathing pattern and the way the body feels as it moves through space. 
                
                Meditation: There are many types of meditation practice, but if someone is new to meditation or just wants a way to relax during stressful times, keep it simple. Find or create a distraction-free zone and sit or lie down—whatever is most comfortable—for 10 or 15 minutes of quiet time or prayer. Try to disregard thoughts as they arise and instead focus on your breathing pattern and other physical cues. Another type of meditation involves contracting and relaxing the muscles, starting at the toes and moving through each muscle group until the muscles of your face and head are reached. Finally, there are countless phone apps and YouTube videos with guided meditation, which can be a great place to start. 
                
                Breathing exercises: Breathing exercises are sometimes performed in combination with meditation, but they can also be performed on their own. As few as 10 mindful breaths can relax the mind and body and allow one to refocus. There are a number of techniques that can be explored, including diaphragmatic breathing and pursed-lip breathing, but here is a simple way to start: put one hand on the stomach and the other on the chest. Breathe slowly and be aware of how the air moves in and out of the body, inflating and deflating with each breath. 
                
                Normalizing this type of discussion in a way that does not single out any individual or group can be a powerful and important step toward explicitly drawing a connection between physical activity and mental health, resulting in improved overall well-being.

            <h2 class="topic">Mindfulness and Peak Performance</h2>

            <p class="content">High-performing athletes and coaches recognize that mental preparation is just as important as physical preparation to achieve athletic excellence, and are turning to mindfulness practices to enhance workouts, recovery and performance in competition, and to cope with daily life pressures. Fortunately, there are numerous resources available featuring a variety of practices that can be used to support athletes and coaches in their quest for peak performance in sports and activities.

                Studies have shown that mindfulness practices can produce positive results in overall health for both emotional and physical well-being, and that mindfulness practices can change the brain and behavior, which may lead to improved focus, concentration and athletic performance. Whether your client is a professional, elite or amateur athlete, or simply a weekend warrior, improved mental focus can be the difference between success and failure.
                
                Mindfulness Practices and Concepts
                Positivity and Positive Self-talk
                Most of us have an inner monologue running non-stop in our brains. The key to utilizing positive self-talk to improve performance and manage anxiety is to be aware of this inner monologue and focus on how to best manage this internal chatter to achieve optimum results. It is important that individuals tune into the conversations in their heads to identify when negative self-talk occurs and, over time, begin to change the narrative and tone to positive affirmations. For example:
                
                Negative self-talk: “I am too lazy to get up for early morning workouts.”
                
                Positive self-talk: “I can and will get to bed early to be at my best for early morning workouts.”
                
                This awareness and ability to change requires practice and won’t happen overnight—but it can happen. In fact, a 2012 study found that even very young children can learn to correct negative self-talk.
                
                Yoga
                Yoga, which literally means the union of mind and body, is a physical mindfulness practice that has proven benefits for everyone. A wide variety of yoga practices is available and athletes may need to discern which yoga style is best suited for their specific sports. For example, power lifters, sprinters and other power-driven sports athletes may benefit from slower yoga practices such as yin where postures are held for anywhere between 60 seconds and 10 minutes to increase flexibility and encourage a feeling of release and letting go. Restorative yoga is another healing practice and utilizes supported postures that are held for longer periods; this type of yoga encourages rest, relaxation and assists in the release of tension in the body and mind. Yoga nidra, which translates to “yogic sleep,” is a practice that is passive in nature and involves the use of a  guided meditation that takes you into a sleep state and promotes deep mental relaxation. It is meant to train the conscious mind to remain aware while diving deep into the different levels of dream and sleep states. When this occurs, the brain and body are relaxed completely and the benefits of sleep are realized, but in a much shorter time span.
                
                Journaling
                Journaling is widely accepted as a means for cultivating wellness. While many athletes keep some sort of training diary, journaling is a mindfulness practice that can allow athletes to go to an internal place to figure things out and strategize on how to achieve future goals. Journaling is a written account of how an athlete perceives and reflects on their performances, successes and failures. Journaling also offers athletes the opportunity to explore their inner life and make changes to their outer lives, thus gaining greater self-awareness, confidence and personal growth.
                
                Meditation
                Research suggests that, for some people, meditation may offer benefits equal to traditional therapy. The researchers were able to identify the physical changes—on a molecular level—that result from a mindful meditation practice, thereby increasing our understanding of how a consistent meditation practice benefits overall health, reduces stress and for athletes enhances performance. Meditation may also be used to help athletes control negative thoughts and sports anxiety, enabling them to focus on their skills in the present moment and perform better.
